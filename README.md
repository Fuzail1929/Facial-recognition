Problem statement Facial recognition is an important and more preferred bio metric when compared to other bio metrics. One of the primary reason is that it requires no physical interaction on behalf of the user. For face recognition there are two types of comparisons:

Verification: In this the system compares the given individual to that the individual says they are and responds with a yes or a no.

Identification: This is where the system compares the given individual to all the other individuals in the database and recognizes that person.

In this project we implement the Identification system using Machine Learning concepts such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and KNN.
